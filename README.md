###Overview of Project:

This Workbook was designed to analyze the entire stock market over the last few years. The original code includes a run button that runs an analysis for all of the stocks that includes a total volume and a Return percentage. The refactored code asks for user input specifying which year results need to be displayed, runs an analysis for the year typed into the message box, then displays a run time. The purpose of this project was to refactor the code to shorten the time it takes to run the analysis.


###Results:
The original code with the run button took a whole 3 seconds to display the results. The newly refactored code took less than a second for both 2017 and 2018, as displayed in the images below:

###Summary:
Advantages of refactoring code are that not only does it help find bugs, it allows for cleaner code that runs faster and more efficiently. Refactoring is essential to make the code more adaptive.
Cons of refactoring code is that if you are not precise, you end up messing up your whole code with one tiny bug.
I originally ran into some issues when defining the Ticker Index, or just defining variables correctly in general but was able to work through it with help of a TA.
The pros and cons are applicable to the original code because when refactoring, I defintely ran into a lot of bugs from either not defining properly or indention mistakes, but after working through these bugs the clean code was worth it. The pros applied because the code was cleaner and ran faster.
